# sasm
Don't you want to have to remember all of registers and their capacity in all of *ASM? There you find what you are looking for!
It's a Stack ASM.

# Instructions
For now, SASM hasn't `jmp` or `jne`, `jnz`, etc., but it has `call` which allow you to invoke other programs and push the result on the stack in the program where there was a call. (As now, even this isn't implemented).

# Why it exists?
It is going to be a core of VOLR (Vegetating and Old Languages Runtime) in CVM (Common Virtual Machine).

# License

# Known issues
